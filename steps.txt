fun part 
we are going to write malware viruses keylogger backdoor etc and etc
writing malware=writing evil code
14.dow_exe_repo.py(lezagne work most execute in window do it when wifi hits in your home)
credential harvestor
exploit xss vulnerability
target find code of moxie called SSLstrip

this programs need python interpreter to run most linux distro comes with it but in window manually install python to run
this is py interpretor not linux emulator .so if your code relies on  command of linux then window is not the one to run those script
